# Debugging a failing run

Paths below sit under the configured `output` directory; `.e2e` is the
default.

## Read the failure

1. Run with `--reporter list,markdown`: `list` ends with a `Failed Tests`
   section, the markdown reporter's `Failures` line names `.e2e/failures/`.
2. Open the failed test's page under `.e2e/failures/` and grep `Expected:`
   / `Observed:` (an `expect`), `Asked for:` and `Waited:` (a locator),
   `Look at:` (the line it unwound through), whether every attempt
   failed alike (a bug, not a flake), the steps, the last model turns of a
   failed agent step, and the accessibility tree at failure, one node per
   line. Fix from what was there.
3. `.e2e/report.json` backs the pages:

```bash
jq '.run | {status, exitCode, errors}' .e2e/report.json
jq '.run.results[] | select(.selected and .status != "passed") | {titlePath, file, status}' .e2e/report.json
jq '.run.results[] | select(.selected and .status != "passed") | .attempts[-1]
    | {status, error, failure, steps: [.steps[] | select(.status != "passed") | {api, label, source, status, error}], artifacts}' .e2e/report.json
```

   `error.details` holds the facts, `error.source` the line, `failure` the
   `url`, `screen` and `screenshot` artifact ids, and `candidates`; a
   failed agent step has `turns`; `selected` drops filtered-out tests
   (recorded as `skipped`).
4. Artifacts, under `.e2e/artifacts/`: `failure/screen.txt`
   and the engine's screenshot per failed attempt; a Playwright trace per
   traced attempt (`npx playwright show-trace <file>`); downloads; with
   `--video` the recording (`video/video.webm` in a local browser, each
   later page `video/video-part<n>.webm` with its own `startedAt`;
   `video/video.mp4` on a device; a provider's file or link); with
   `--debug` every agent step's transcript.

## Error codes

| Code | Usual cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CONFIG_LOAD_FAILED` | The config throws while loading (a refused engine option is `INVALID_CONFIG` instead) or imports a missing package, subpath, or removed export such as `defineConfig` | Install the dependency, or fix the import or line quoted |
| `INVALID_CONFIG`, `INVALID_GLOB` | Unknown or foreign key (`app`, `webServer`, `use`, `projects`, `baseURL`), `json` with `list`; a `tests` glob with braces, classes, an absolute path, or no wildcard | The message names the key or glob to write; the app is declared in the target's `app` |
| `CONFIG_NOT_FOUND`, `CONFIG_AMBIGUOUS` | Wrong `--config` path; both `.ts` and `.mts` present | Fix the path; keep one |
| `NO_TESTS` | The glob, a positional, or a filter matched nothing; the message names each empty positional and each undeclared `--tag` with the nearest declared one | Check the config `tests`, the `.e2e.ts` suffix, the tag names |
| `NO_LAST_RUN` | `--last-failed` found no `.e2e/report.json` | Run once without it |
| `COLLECTION_ERROR` | `async` describe body, `test.setup` inside `describe`, an option forbidden in a serial group, registration outside collection | Restructure per `writing-tests` |
| `HOOK_FAILED` | `beforeAll` or `afterAll` threw; its scope's tests skip | Fix the hook; the report carries its error |
| `UNSUPPORTED_ARTIFACT` | A test's or target's `trace` or `video` on an engine that cannot record | Drop it there, or set it at the config root or CLI (such targets skip with a notice) |
| `BROWSER_INSTALL_FAILED`, `LAUNCH_TIMEOUT` | Browser download failed; engine init or attempt start exceeded `launchTimeout` | Run the quoted `npx playwright install <names>` (`--with-deps` on bare Linux); raise the root `launchTimeout` (60 s default) |
| `APP_UNREACHABLE` | `app.command` never answered `readyUrl` within `startupTimeout`; on a device, a message naming the iOS automation runner: the runner failed, not the app | Read the quoted log lines; check the port, `app.url`, `app.command.env`, `app.command.startupTimeout`. Runner: rerun, else `npx agent-device daemon stop` and reboot the simulator |
| `APP_ALREADY_RUNNING` | Something already serves `url` when `command` should start | Stop it, or `reuseExisting: true` locally |
| `APP_URL_REQUIRED`, `APP_NOT_OPEN` | A navigation on a target without `app.url`; a `screen` call before `app.open()` | Add `app.url` to the target; open the app first |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `INVALID_LOCATOR` | A step argument failed validation; a locator got a bad option or filter key | Fix the call the code frame names |
| `LOCATOR_NOT_FOUND` | Wrong role or name, inexact text, element off screen or in an iframe, page not open | Read the markup for the accessible name; `exact: false` or a RegExp; `browser.frameLocator` for iframes; `app.open()` first; `--headed` |
| `LOCATOR_AMBIGUOUS` | Two matches (hidden duplicate, repeated label) | `{ name }`, a container scope, `filter`, `first()`, or `{ visible: true }` |
| `ASSERTION_FAILED` | Wrong expectation, or the state settles later than 5 s; for `agent.assert`, a false judgment (explained in the report) | Compare with the report's actual text or the screenshot; `{ timeout }` on the matcher; rewrite the question |
| `ASSERTION_INCONCLUSIVE` | `agent.assert` or `agent.extract` asked about what the screen does not show (another page, still loading, only in pixels); a failure, never a pass | `app.open()` or `agent.waitFor` the right screen first; ask about what is shown; `vision: true` when the answer is in pixels (the message says so) |
| `MODEL_OUTPUT_INVALID` | An `extract` or `assert` answer failed the schema after one repair round | Simplify the schema or question; pick a stronger model |
| `ACTION_FAILED` | Element not actionable (covered, disabled, detached), or an operation timed out | `expect` the condition first; close overlays; check `actionTimeout` |
| `TEST_TIMEOUT` | The attempt exceeded `timeout` (120 s) | Split the test, or raise `timeout` |
| `STEP_NOT_AWAITED` | The body returned while a step still ran: a call without `await` | `await` the call the code frame names (every `app`, `agent`, `screen`, `expect` call) |
| `MODEL_UNAVAILABLE` | `agents.<name>.model` holds no AI SDK instance: reported once under `run.errors` at the first `agent` fixture; the run stops. A model-less custom executor fails only `waitFor` and `extract` this way | Construct one, e.g. `gateway('openai/gpt-6-luna-fast')` from `ai`, and export its key (`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY`) |
| `MODEL_PROVIDER_FAILED` | Network, 5xx, rate limit, no credits, or no response in 120 s, after the transport retries | Check the credential (the key; for keyless `gateway()` the Vercel CLI login and `.vercel/project.json`) and quota; retry (exit 3) |
| `REPLAY_STALE` | `--strict-cache` or `cache.strict`, and a committed recording no longer replays; `step.cache.reason` says why | Rerun read-write with the knob the message names off; commit the changed entry under the directory it names (a custom `cache.store` is written by that run) |
| `AUTOMATION_UNSUPPORTED` | The step needs an interaction the engine's toolset lacks (drag on a device, say); blocked, exit 1 | Do that step with `screen` actions, or run the test on a target that supports it |
| `STEP_TIMEOUT`, `STEP_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` | Goal too big or ambiguous, or a slow provider | Split the goal, use on-screen wording, add vocabulary via `agents.<name>.context` or `agentContext`; raise `maxSteps` or `maxModelCalls` (budget), the config `timeout` (`act`), `judgmentTimeout` (judgments); `--debug` |
| `CONTEXT_OVERFLOW` | Screen plus step history did not fit the model's context window (`act` after one shrink-and-retry; a judgment on the first overflow) | Lower `agents.<name>.maxObservationBytes`, split the step, or pick a larger-window model |
| `POLICY_DENIED` | A `file:`, `data:`, or `javascript:` URL; a password `Secret` into a non-password sink; reading a secure field, `toHaveValue`, `toHaveText`, `toContainText`, `toHaveAttribute` included; `app.screenshot()` after a secret fill | http(s) only; passwords into password inputs only; assert the outcome, not the value; screenshot before filling secrets |
| `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY` | A fixture the engine lacks (`browser` on a device), `schema` or `vision` on `act`, an action the surface lacks | Declare `requires: ['browser']`; drop the option or action |
| `SESSION_UNAVAILABLE`, `SESSION_CONTRACT` | `session: 'x'` with no setup saving `x`; a setup that skipped a declared name. `SESSION_MISMATCH`, `SESSION_EXPIRED`, `SESSION_INVALID`: the stored session is another run's or app's, expired, or corrupt | Add or fix the `test.setup`; rerun it |
| `ONLY_IN_CI` | `test.only` reached CI | Remove it |
| `AUTH_CREDENTIAL_UNAVAILABLE`, `AUTH_CREDENTIAL_INVALID` | `credentials.user('x')` for an undeclared name; the app rejected a configured credential | Add it to `config.credentials`; fix the stored value |
| `SECRET_UNAVAILABLE` | `secrets.get('x')` for an undeclared name | Add it to `config.secrets`; `E2E_SECRET_X` only overrides a declared one |

## Tools

| Do | When |
| --- | --- |
| `--headed` | Watch the failing step |
| `--workers 1 --retries 0` | Take parallelism and retries out of the picture |
| `--no-cache` | Rule out a stale `agent.act` replay |
| `--debug` | Each agent step's duration, model calls, cost, transcript |
| `--ai-trace`, then `npx unbox-ai runs .e2e/ai-trace.json` | What the model saw and called |
| `--video`, `--video=retain-on-failure` | Watch the failed attempt; `step.startedAt` minus the segment's `startedAt` is the step's offset into it |
| `command.log: '.e2e/logs/app.log'` | The app's output when it never gets ready or errors mid-test |
| `await app.screenshot('before-submit')` | Evidence before a secret is filled; later calls fail with `POLICY_DENIED` |
| `CI=1 npx e2e run` | Reproduce CI-only behaviour (defaults: topic running) |

## Flaky tests

- A read (`textContent()`, `count()`) caught a value mid-update: use a
  matcher.
- Shared data: unique names per run, `afterEach` cleanup, or a `serial`
  group.
- App not ready: assert on the element you are about to use, not the
  previous page.
- An agent judgment asserts exact phrasing: judge the fact, add a
  deterministic `expect` beside it.
- Load timing: `retries` masks it; `--workers 1 --headed` shows it.
- Measure a fix: `npx e2e run <file> --repeat-each 10 --retries 0`
  (`--no-cache` for agent steps). `Repeats` reads `0 of 1 test passed all
  10 runs` over `3/10 passed · repeat 0 ASSERTION_FAILED · ...` (0-based)
  before, `1 of 1 test passed all 10 runs` after.

## Is it the app?

A deterministic step failing every run at the same place with the same code
is a product bug or a changed screen, not a flake: reproduce once with
`--headed`, then fix the app or update locator and expectation together. A
blocked agent step (`AUTH_CREDENTIAL_UNAVAILABLE`, `ENVIRONMENT_UNAVAILABLE`,
`SEED_DATA_MISSING`) exits 2 or 3 on purpose: fix the environment.

# Agent steps

`agent` is a fixture like `screen` and the main way a test drives the app.
Each call is one bounded invocation: fresh redacted observation, deadline,
model-call budget, no shared transcript. No agent step, no model calls.

## Configure a model

Put an AI SDK model under `agents.default`. Vercel AI Gateway reads
`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` or, without it, a Vercel OIDC token:

```ts
import type { E2EConfig } from 'e2e';
import { web } from '@e2e-dev/web';
import { gateway } from 'ai';

export default {
  targets: [{ engine: web(), app: { url: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000' } }],
  agents: { default: { model: gateway('openai/gpt-6-luna-fast') } },
} satisfies E2EConfig;
```

Subscription logins and local models:
[setup](setup.md#subscriptions-and-api-keys). Keep `ai@^7` installed with
any provider.

- Pass a model instance, not a string (`INVALID_CONFIG`).
- An agents entry is one plain object of `model`, `judge`, `system`,
  `context`, `tools`, `maxSteps`, `maxModelCalls`, `judgmentTimeout`,
  `maxObservationBytes`, `maxInputTokens`, `providerOptions`, or `executor`
  for a custom brain; none inherits `model` or `context` from `default`.
- `model` drives `agent.act`. Judgments use `judge` when set, else `model`.
- A missing model for the built-in agent raises one run-level
  `MODEL_UNAVAILABLE` when the first test acquires `agent`, exit 2; auth
  failures surface on the first model call as `MODEL_PROVIDER_FAILED`.
- `context` is what the app calls things, sent to every model call, judges
  included; `system` is how the acting agent works, read only by the act
  loop. Both live on the agents entry; `agentContext` on a test or group
  adds more.

### Choose an agent

Tests use `agents.default` unless selected otherwise:

- `e2e run --agent buyer` picks another configured agent.
- `{ agent: 'buyer' }` on a test or group pins that agent; a list such as
  `{ agent: ['buyer', 'admin'] }` runs each test once per agent.
- `--agent buyer,admin` runs unpinned tests for both, narrows a pinned list
  to matching names, never replacing a pin it does not name.
- `{ agent: 'name' }` on an `agent.*` call overrides the test's choice.

For signed-in personas, pair an agent with a `session` in a describe block
repeated per persona; the cache records per agent step, so a specialised
agent replays too.

## act: one goal

```ts
import { credentials } from 'e2e';

await agent.act('add a todo named "Buy milk" and mark it done');
await agent.act('invite {email} as an editor', { params: { email: 'ada@example.test' } });

const member = credentials.user('member');
await agent.act('sign in with the given credentials', {
  params: {
    username: member.username,
    password: member.password, // a Secret: the model sees its name, the runner fills the field
  },
});
```

`act(instruction, options?)` runs a multi-action flow to a verdict. Passed
resolves with `summary`, `modelCalls`, `actions`, and `cache` (the replay
cache's part). Failed or blocked throws an `AgentError` whose `code` says
why: `ACTION_FAILED` (product failure); `STEP_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`,
`STEP_TIMEOUT`, `CONTEXT_OVERFLOW` (out of room);
`AUTH_CREDENTIAL_UNAVAILABLE`, `AUTH_CREDENTIAL_INVALID`,
`SECRET_UNAVAILABLE`, `ENVIRONMENT_UNAVAILABLE`, `SEED_DATA_MISSING`,
`TEST_SETUP_FAILED`, `AUTOMATION_UNSUPPORTED`, `POLICY_DENIED` (blocked
from outside);
`MODEL_OUTPUT_INVALID` (unusable answer). Full list: topic debugging.

Options:

- `params`: values the instruction names; the runner fills a `Secret`,
  and a run-unique `unique(\`E2E ${Date.now()}\`)` keeps the cache working
  across runs.
- `timeout`: the config `timeout`.
- `maxSteps` (default 25 actions), `maxModelCalls` (default 25): may only
  lower the agent's limits, else `INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
- No `schema` (use `extract({ schema })`) and no `vision`: the model decides
  when it needs pixels.

The tools, one per engine action. Name the target as the screen names it
(files in `params`); the agent picks the verb:

- `observe`: re-read the screen after waiting on work in progress.
- `tap`: button, link, menu item, tab, checkbox, row, field.
- `double_tap`/`long_press`/`right_click`: second-click item, long-press
  menu, context menu only.
- `hover`: menus, flyouts, tooltips that open on the pointer.
- `type`: one input; on browser/device no target means focus; `replace` clears.
- `press`: one key to a node or, on browser/device, to focus; `times` up to 20.
- `select`: one option by visible label.
- `check`: set a checkbox, switch, or radio to a state, not flip it.
- `scroll`: viewport or one scrollable node, a screen or a few.
- `scroll_to`: a listed node into view, or by `text` page a list to a row.
- `drag`: one node onto another.
- `upload`: project-root files to a file input; outside it or hidden (`.env`)
  is `POLICY_DENIED`.
- `navigate`: a URL or app-relative path.
- `back`: browser history or in-app back.
- `type_secret`: a declared secret by name; plaintext never reaches the model.
  Offered only when the step declares secrets and the engine can fill them.
- `screenshot`: attach viewport pixels; every later result then carries one.
- `tap_at`/`hover_at`/`press_at`/`select_at`/`type_at`: a screenshot point.
- `dismiss_keyboard` (device): hide the on-screen keyboard.

The focused field's selected text is listed as `selection="..."` (never for
a secret), so a repeated `Shift+ArrowLeft` selects one word with visible
feedback. Point tools serve a canvas shape, map pin, image region, or system
sheet control, hit-testing the tree first so a listed control underneath is
acted on by id; `type_at` on nothing listed taps, then types. A screen with
nothing to tap by id opens with a screenshot attached. A device has no
`right_click`, `select`, `upload`, or `scroll_to` by node id. Pixels are
masked and withheld after a secret fill (topic writing-tests): act on pixels
before signing in, or in a test of its own. A result says when an action
closed an on-screen keyboard; on a touch screen that tap was often spent
closing it, so act again.

## assert, waitFor, extract: one question

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';

await agent.assert('the dashboard shows a trial badge'); // one look, one judgment

await agent.waitFor('the export finished and a download link appeared', { // polls
  interval: 500,
  timeout: 120_000,
});

const data = await agent.extract('every todo title and how many remain', { // structured output
  schema: z.object({ titles: z.array(z.string()), remaining: z.number().int() }),
});
expect(data.titles).toContain('Buy milk');
```

- `assert` does not poll. False is `ASSERTION_FAILED` with the model's
  explanation and a screenshot in the report; too little on screen to
  decide is `ASSERTION_INCONCLUSIVE`, also a failure, so reach the right
  screen first and ask about what is visible. Judged from the tree alone,
  it adds `pass vision: true when the answer is in pixels`, as does
  `waitFor`'s timeout after an inconclusive round.
- Judgments see the assertion and the current screen only, never prior
  steps or the act loop's summaries; malformed output gets one repair
  round, then `MODEL_OUTPUT_INVALID`.
- `waitFor` observes every `interval` (default 3 s), judges only when the
  screen changed, and is `STEP_TIMEOUT` after `timeout` (default 30 s).
- `extract` takes any Standard Schema validator (zod works); the model sees
  the schema's shape, never its value rules (`min`, `max`, lengths,
  patterns), which check what it read. Data the screen does not show is
  `ASSERTION_INCONCLUSIVE` naming what was missing, never `""` or `0`; to
  accept absence, ask for it (`'the phone, or null when none is shown'`
  with `.nullable()`).

`vision` on a judgment picks the evidence: `false` (default) the tree;
`true` the tree plus a masked screenshot; `'only'` the screenshot alone, for
what the screen presents (an overlay, a broken layout, a chart) where the
tree would answer first. `'only'` never falls back to the tree: unprovably
masked pixels fail with `POLICY_DENIED`.

## Write instructions the model can execute

- One goal per `act`; goal order is the test's, the path the model's.
- Use the words on screen: `'open the Billing tab'`, not `'upgrade'`.
- Values go in `params`, never expanded: `act('rename to {name}', { params })`.
- Do not describe mechanics the runner handles: waiting, scrolling, retries.
- Pin every `act` outcome right after it; that check lets the cache record:

```ts
await agent.act('create a workspace named "Atlas" on the Pro plan');
await expect(screen.getByRole('status')).toHaveText('Created "Atlas" on the Pro plan');
```

The model gets the instruction verbatim plus the params as a separate
block; the check also makes the test model-portable. Off-screen state (a
database row) can land after `act` returns; `expect.poll` the read instead
of sleeping.

## What the model sees

A redacted snapshot of the screen (roles, names, text, states), prior-step
summaries, and your context; never raw HTML, cookies, headers, environment
values, or a `Secret`'s value; password fields masked. The first
screen of a step arrives whole; later action results report what changed,
keyed by node ids stable while an element exists, or the whole screen when
most changed. Pixels arrive through `vision` on a judgment or the act loop's
`screenshot` and point tools, masked and withheld after a secret fill. When
the browser engine's tree capture times out, the model gets a screenshot and
a warning, a judgment needs `vision: true`, and no control may be inferred
absent nor old node ids reused. Nothing the model returns runs as code or
selectors: the runner validates and authorizes every tool call first.

## Budgets and cost

| Call | Model calls | Default timeout |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `act` | up to `agents.<name>.maxModelCalls` (25) | the config `timeout`, 120 s |
| `assert` | 2 | 30 s |
| `extract` | 2 | 30 s |
| `waitFor` | up to `agents.<name>.maxModelCalls` (25) | 30 s |

- Slow model calls: raise the step or test `timeout` for `act`, the agent's
  `judgmentTimeout` for judgments, `actionTimeout` for slow UI.
  `STEP_TIMEOUT` and `STEP_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` fail the test; smaller goals
  help.
- `--debug` prints phase timings and a per-step table (duration, model
  calls, tokens, cache share, cost) to stderr and saves step transcripts as
  artifacts.

## The replay cache

A passing `agent.act` saves its actions once a later check verifies the
outcome; the next run replays them without model calls, and the live agent
continues from the current screen when the app or final state no longer
matches. Misses and hand-offs use the model; `agent.assert`,
`agent.waitFor`, and `agent.extract` are never cached.

- On by default (`read-write`), `read-only` in CI, off via `cache: 'off'`
  or `--no-cache`. Entries live in `.e2e/cache/`; deleting the directory
  only slows the next run.
- An entry is written only after a later verification passes (a locator or
  engine `expect` matcher, `locator.waitFor`, `browser.waitForURL`,
  `agent.assert`, `agent.waitFor`), so an unchecked `act` never replays; a
  plain-value `expect`, `expect.poll`, `agent.extract`, another `act`, or
  the attempt passing confirms nothing.
- A replay needs the app on the recorded path (unless the recording opens
  with a navigation), re-finds each control by role, name, test id,
  placeholder, and input purpose, and passes alone only when the recorded
  end path and the controls seen during the step are back; otherwise the
  agent takes over mid-step. `step.cache.reason` says why: `no-entry`,
  `wrong-context`, `target-not-found`, `target-ambiguous`, `end-mismatch`,
  and so on.
- A step recording no actions creates no entry; one whose `unique()` value
  equals, is spelled inside, or is the encoded form of another param's value
  is not recorded either (`step.cache.notRecorded`: `param-collision`).
- `e2e init` gitignores `.e2e/cache/`; remove that line to commit entries
  and share replays with CI and teammates (CI stays `read-only` unless
  `cache: 'read-write'` is set).
- A failing run evicts the entries it implicates; `--no-cache` rules the
  cache out of a failure.
- With committed recordings, `--strict-cache` in CI fails a recording that
  no longer replays with `REPLAY_STALE` instead of quietly spending model
  calls every run; re-record locally and commit. Unrecorded steps still run
  live.

## Inspect what the model did

```bash
npx e2e run tests/checkout.e2e.ts --debug      # step table, transcripts as artifacts
npx e2e run tests/checkout.e2e.ts --ai-trace   # writes <output>/ai-trace.json (.e2e/ai-trace.json by default)
npx unbox-ai runs .e2e/ai-trace.json                        # one line per agent step
npx unbox-ai summary .e2e/ai-trace.json --run 0             # turns, tokens, tool calls of one step
```

Never read the trace directly: megabytes of resent context, images replaced
by byte counts. `--no-cache` traces the whole flow, since replayed steps
make no model calls.

## Make the agent yours

1. **The goal.** A failed step usually named something the screen does not;
   reword it with on-screen labels, and `--debug` shows what the model saw
   and tried.
2. **`context`.** Vocabulary every step needs (plan names, what a
   "workspace" is, which tab holds billing), once on `agents.<name>.context`
   or per test via `agentContext`.
3. **`system` on the agent.** How carefully it verifies, what it never
   does, how it treats a modal; a UX reviewer, a cautious QA persona, and a
   fast smoke agent are three `system` prompts on one model.
4. **Tools.** A test API the agent may call mid-flow (seed a cart, mint a
   coupon) via `tools`; see below.
5. **The model and its options.** `providerOptions` for reasoning effort,
   or another model for one persona. `--agent <name>` runs the suite as any
   configured agent, comparing candidates on the same tests; every result
   records which agent ran it.

## Beyond the built-in agent

- `tools: { seedCart }` on an agents entry adds AI SDK tools wrapped with
  `defineTool(tool({ ... }), { mutates: true })` from `e2e/agent` for a
  test API a flow calls mid-step.
- `createToolLoopExecutor` keeps the loop and replaces prompt and tool
  vocabulary.
- Any `StepExecutor` (`{ name, version?, cache?, runStep(ctx) }`) goes under
  `executor`; the runner still owns observations, actions, budgets, and the
  report, and `system` or `tools` beside `executor` is `INVALID_CONFIG`.

## In CI

Run the suite, agent steps included, on every pull request, passing the key
the config's model reads (`env: { AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY }` for `gateway()`)
from secrets. Sharing `.e2e/cache/` lets CI replay verified action steps
without model calls; CI defaults (`read-only` cache, retries): topic running.
